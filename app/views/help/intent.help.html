<h4>What is an intent and why we should use</h4>
<p>We need to understand what your end-user wants to perform. They will ask various things, to understand the action
    we use intents. Few example actions are listed below, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>Ask about the weather</b><br>&nbsp;
    - <b>Book a restaurant</b><br>&nbsp;
    - <b>Open the garage door</b><br><br>
    The problem is that there a millions of different ways to express a given intent. For instance,
    all the following expressions should be mapped to the same intent:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;- <b>What is the weather in Paris?</b><br>&nbsp;
    - <b>Give me the current weather in Paris</b><br>&nbsp;
    - <b>Is it sunny or rainy in Paris now?</b>&nbsp;</p>
