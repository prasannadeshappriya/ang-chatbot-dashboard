<h4>How to train your bot for expressions</h4>
<p>If you input your expression and bot will not answer it correctly, you can manually train your bot for that kind
of expressions, let's try some example tutorial <br>
Assume user input <b>'I want to fly to Sri Lanka'</b> and bot didn't reply as expected. you can
go to <b>App -> Train Bot</b> section, and input as follows,<br><br>
Input expression: <br>'<b>I want to fly to Sri Lanka'</b><br>
1) entity: '<b>intent</b>'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    value: '<b>flight_request</b>'<br>
2) entity: '<b>wit$location</b>'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    value: '<b>Sri Lanka</b>'<br><br>
Click on validate after insert all value and expression pairs<br>
    <b>Note:</b><br>Put your expression, <b>'I want to fly to Sri Lanka'</b> again and click on validate Button.
    now your intent should be there :)
